## 1. Objective

The objective of this test plan is to validate the functionality of the Dijkstra-based shortest path algorithm implemented in Python. The algorithm calculates the shortest path between a set of coordinates. We will ensure the correctness of the results by testing various scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and invalid conditions.

## 2. Scope

The tests will focus on the following functionalities:

- Shortest path calculation between coordinates.
- Proper handling of disconnected graphs.
- Handling of graphs with adyacent coordinates.
- Performance with large distances.
- Handling identical initial and final coordinates.
